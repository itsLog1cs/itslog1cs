# こんにちは!

a student from Thuy Loi University, apparently I loved it one day.

studying robotics, I hate it so much (someone please get me out of here, language™️ majors are fine).

## My projects (at all, I'm your local buildbot™️):
[LycorisOSS](https://github.com/LycorisOSS) **is where I store my inactive and rarely active repos.** 

[nokia-msm8998](https://github.com/nokia-msm8998) - **Device configurations to build AOSP and everything related to Nokia (of course, it's the HMD Nokia one, not the old one) that came with MSM8998/SDM660 out of the box, you can probably found what you need here.**

[lge-sdm845](https://github.com/lge-sdm845) - **Device configurations to build AOSP for LG devices that came with SDM845 out of the box.**
