# こんにちは!

a student from Thuy Loi University, apparently I loved it one day.

studying robotics, I hate it so much (someone please get me out of here, language™️ majors are fine).

## Some projects I've been working on recently:
[LycorisOSS](https://github.com/LycorisOSS) - **is where I store my inactive and rarely active repos.** 

[nokia-msm8998](https://github.com/nokia-msm8998) - **Device configurations to build AOSP for Nokia devices that are powered by msm8998/sdm660 platform.**

[lge-sdm845](https://github.com/lge-sdm845) - **Device configurations to build AOSP for LG phones that are powered by sdm845 platform.**
